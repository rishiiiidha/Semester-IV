RC4 Stream Cipher Lab Exercise
Exercise:Write a C/C++/Java program to implement RC4 Stream Ciphering algorithm.
Instructions and Steps:
1. Ask user to provide a key (K) <= 256 bytes.
2. Initialize a byte array S as per the RC4 initialization requirements.
3. Fill a byte array T with key (K) bytes.
4. Permute S with the help of T as per RC4 initial permutation.
5. Generate random stream of bytes (k) with the help of S as per RC4 stream generationprocedure.
6. Ask user to enter plaintext bytes (P).
7. Perform XOR between plaintext (P) and random stream of bytes (k) to encrypt theplaintext to ciphertext bytes (C).
8. Decrypt ciphertext (C) to restore plaintext bytes (P) using the same stream of randomstream of bytes (k)
